# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose of challenge:
Is to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and we would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and we would like to see the data on a third map. This challenge involves using JavaScript and APIs to visually tell a story about earthquakes around the world.
